# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

Snapmaker_Orca is an open-source 3D slicer application forked from Bambu Studio, built using C++ with wxWidgets for the GUI and CMake as the build system. The project uses a modular architecture with separate libraries for core slicing functionality, GUI components, and platform-specific code.

### Build System
- Uses CMake with minimum version 3.13 (maximum 3.31.x on Windows)
- Primary build directory: `build/`
- Dependencies are built in `deps/build/`
- The build process is split into dependency building and main application building
- Windows builds use Visual Studio generators
- macOS builds use Xcode by default, Ninja with -x flag
- Linux builds use Ninja generator

### Testing
Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use the Catch2 testing framework. Test structure:
- `tests/libslic3r/` - Core library tests (21 test files)
  - Geometry processing, algorithms, file formats (STL, 3MF, AMF)
  - Polygon operations, clipper utilities, Voronoi diagrams
- `tests/fff_print/` - Fused Filament Fabrication tests (12 test files)
  - Slicing algorithms, G-code generation, print mechanics
  - Fill patterns, extrusion, support material
- `tests/sla_print/` - Stereolithography tests (4 test files)
  - SLA-specific printing algorithms, support generation
- `tests/libnest2d/` - 2D nesting algorithm tests
- `tests/slic3rutils/` - Utility function tests
- `tests/sandboxes/` - Experimental/sandbox test code

Run all tests after building:
```bash
cd build && ctest
```

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

Run individual test suites:
```bash
# From build directory
./tests/libslic3r/libslic3r_tests
./tests/fff_print/fff_print_tests
./tests/sla_print/sla_print_tests
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Standards
- **C++17 standard** with selective C++20 features
- **Naming conventions**: PascalCase for classes, snake_case for functions/variables
- **Header guards**: Use `#pragma once` 
- **Memory management**: Prefer smart pointers, RAII patterns
- **Thread safety**: Use TBB for parallelization, be mindful of shared state

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding New Print Settings
1. Define setting in `PrintConfig.cpp` with proper bounds and defaults
2. Add UI controls in appropriate GUI components  
3. Update serialization in config save/load
4. Add tooltips and help text for user guidance
5. Test with different printer profiles

#### Modifying Slicing Algorithms  
1. Core algorithms live in `libslic3r/` subdirectories
2. Performance-critical code should be profiled and optimized
3. Consider multi-threading implications (TBB integration)
4. Validate changes don't break existing profiles
5. Add regression tests where appropriate

#### GUI Development
1. GUI code resides in `src/slic3r/GUI/` (not visible in current tree)
2. Use existing wxWidgets patterns and custom controls
3. Support both light and dark themes
4. Consider DPI scaling on high-resolution displays
5. Maintain cross-platform compatibility

#### Adding Printer Support
1. Create JSON profile in `resources/profiles/[manufacturer].json`
2. Add printer-specific start/end G-code templates
3. Configure build volume, capabilities, and material compatibility
4. Test thoroughly with actual hardware when possible
5. Follow existing profile structure and naming conventions

### Dependencies and Build System
- **CMake-based** with separate dependency building phase
- **Dependencies** built once in `deps/build/`, then linked to main application  
- **Cross-platform** considerations important for all changes
- **Resource files** embedded at build time, platform-specific handling

### Performance Considerations
- **Slicing algorithms** are CPU-intensive, profile before optimizing
- **Memory usage** can be substantial with complex models
- **Multi-threading** extensively used via TBB
- **File I/O** optimized for large 3MF files with embedded textures
- **Real-time preview** requires efficient mesh processing

## Important Development Notes

### Codebase Navigation
- Use search tools extensively - codebase has 500k+ lines
- Key entry points: `src/Snapmaker_Orca.cpp` for application startup
- Core slicing: `libslic3r/Print.cpp` orchestrates the slicing pipeline
- Configuration: `PrintConfig.cpp` defines all print/printer/material settings

### Compatibility and Stability
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for project files and profiles
- **Cross-platform** support essential (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
- **File format** changes require careful version handling
- **Profile migrations** needed when settings change significantly

### Quality and Testing
- **Regression testing** important due to algorithm complexity
- **Performance benchmarks** help catch performance regressions
- **Memory leak** detection important for long-running GUI application
- **Cross-platform** testing required before releases
## Local dev tooling (`.claude/tools`)

Run `./.claude/tools/start.sh` with no arguments for the full list. VS Code tasks wrap the
same commands (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "multiACE: …").

### Debugging GUI crashes without a human

There is no gdb in this environment, and a headless agent cannot reach the user's X
session. Two tools close that gap; **use them instead of guessing at a crash.**

    ./.claude/tools/start.sh run        # real display, crash catcher armed (user drives)
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh trace      # resolve the last crash to file:line via addr2line

    ./.claude/tools/start.sh headless   # Xvfb :99 + Orca, crash catcher armed
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh shot x.png # screenshot the virtual display - readable as an image
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh click X Y  # click on the virtual display
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh stop       # stop both

`headless` needs `xvfb` and `xdotool` (installed 2026-08-08). It runs against a **copy** of
`~/.config/Snapmaker_Orca` in `/tmp/orca-headless-datadir`, so it cannot disturb real presets
and can run while the user has Orca open. Coordinates in a screenshot map 1:1 to click
coordinates. The first click into an unfocused window is swallowed - `click` handles that.

This loop found a crash that three rounds of code reading had misdiagnosed. Reproduce, don't
theorise: a wrong fix that ships is worse than an hour of reading.

### Settings-page traps (learned the hard way)

- A `Line` carrying **only a widget** must set `full_width = 1`. `OptionsGroup::activate_line`
  returns early only for full-width widget lines; anything else falls through to
  `get_options().front()` on an empty vector and segfaults as the page activates.
- `full_width` lines draw **no label column**, so put any label inside the widget itself, and
  keep it short - it is clipped, not ellipsised.
- `i_enum_open` (labelled dropdowns) now works for **vector** `coInts` too. Support needed a
  `coInts` case beside `coInt` in *five* places in `Field.cpp` - miss one and it fails far from
  the cause: `Field::get_value_by_opt_type`, `Choice::set_value`, `Choice::get_value`,
  `Choice::set_selection`, and `Choice::propagate_value`. The last one is the nastiest: without
  it a `coInts` value falls into the float default and `boost::any_cast<double>` throws on focus
  change, which escapes the wx handler and aborts the app during teardown - so the crash
  backtrace shows only destructors. Use `THROW_LOG=1` to find throw sites.
  Prefer labelled choices over raw numbers whose meaning must be spelled out in the label.
  Combo fields are ~146px, so keep enum labels short or they are clipped.
- Do not rebuild a page from inside a field's own change handler; it destroys the field
  mid-event.

### Build status page

    ./.claude/tools/start.sh status     # regenerate
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh watch      # regenerate every 10s while a build runs
    ./.claude/tools/start.sh open       # open it

Shows a ninja step counter, ETA over a moving window, and whether the binary on disk is
**older than the newest source file** - the trap being a binary that does not contain the
change under test. Build detection matches `ninja` by name: `cmake --build` is only a wrapper
and a build whose wrapper died still has a live ninja.

### Builds

`build/` is a **Ninja Multi-Config** dir, so Debug builds alongside Release without disturbing
it: `cmake --build build --config Debug --target snapmaker-orca`. Run builds detached
(`setsid nohup`) - they outlive the session. When killing builds, never put the kill pattern in
the same command line that runs the build; `pkill -f` will match your own shell. Use
`pkill -x ninja`.
